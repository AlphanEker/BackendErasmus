# Backend Gone Wild
## About
This backend was being developed for a web application that handles Erasmus application and enrolment process. However then turned into my personal project. There was a database implemented beforehand but I have disconnected and got creative with the usage of the memory and handling accounts. 
After the memory usage changed from a database to a shared local memory, then I wanted to change the implementation as it was a OOP developed application (I know that NodeJS is an OOP language. However I wanted it to be like the traditional OOP such as in Java or cpp).
